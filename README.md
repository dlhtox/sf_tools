LANDesk SF Tools
========

These are all of my userscripts I use to make salesforce more manageable. 

Prerequisites:

[GreaseMonkey - Firefox]
[TamperMonkey - Chrome]
[Go_Google_IT - Internet Exploder]

To install, open the raw master.user.js (https://github.com/b1kjsh/sf_tools/raw/master/master.user.js) and get all the current stable scripts. Or you can add scripts individually by navigating to the UserScripts folder and selecting one from there.

Built into each script is a @downloadURL which will allow your user script engine to check for updates and obtain them from github. So as new stuff is put up you can just click a button in your userscript engine of choice and get the updated version.
